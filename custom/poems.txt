What happens to a dream deferred?

Does it dry up
like a raisin in the sun?
Or fester like a sore-
and then run?

Does it stink like rotten meat?
Or crust and sugar over-
like a syrupy sweet?

Maybe it just sags
like a heavy load.

Or does it explode?

I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

glazed with rain

beside the white

Tyger, tyger, burning bright,
in the forests of the night;
What immortal hand or eye,
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?

Propel, propel, propel your craft,
Gently through liquid solution.

Ecstatically, ecstatically, ecstatically, ecstatically, 
Existence is but an illusion.
